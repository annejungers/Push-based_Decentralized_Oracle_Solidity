This contract is linked with a relayer in https://defender.openzeppelin.com/
which is responsible to provide the data weather

most of the contract logic is perform is Openzeppelin Defender
which is not exactly what was asked in the Labs but can be a good illustration 
of how to move the business logic off-chain and use less gas in Solidity

in the Relayer that we have created in Defender, 
we add as information:
- the ABI of the contract (that we have in remix)
- the contract address
- the function getWeatherData that calls the weather API

to deploy the contract we can only use the relayer address 0x6e9542da1a2a61363a555344fe13a1f463ffbfd8
